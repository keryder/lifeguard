                            Kneel down next to the person to <strong>check for responsiveness</strong>. For adults, this means tapping their shoulder and shouting their name. For small children, tap the bottom of their feet instead of their shoulder. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the person is unresponsive, immediately <strong>call 911</strong>. Pointing at and assigning this role to a specific person reduces the risk of the bystander effect. If nobody was directly asked to call 911, it may lead to a delay in action.

                            <strong>Check for pulse and breathing</strong>. When checking for pulse, place two fingers (not the thumb) on the side of the neck. Tilt the head back with a palm on the forehead and with fingers lifting the chin. Place your ear next to their mouth to listen for breathing while watching if chest inflates.

                            Make sure all parts of your designated zone are within view. Move positions if your view is obstructed by things like glare, objects (people/floats), waves, etc.

                        <li>
                            One full scan should not take more than 10 seconds. Make sure to monitor all areas of the zone, do not solely focus on areas with high activity. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Scan by moving your head, not just your eyes.

                        <li>
                            Pick a scanning pattern: <em>right to left, left to right, diagonal</em>, and change patterns frequently to stay alert.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Change positions every five minutes, either by standing up or walking around. Avoid sitting in one place for too long. When changing positions ensure your scanning does not falter.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid distractions such as: talking to friends, looking at your phone, moving your mind off of the task at hand. <strong>No technology should be on the stand with you</strong>.
