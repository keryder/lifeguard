                Scan zone from bottom (deepest) to top (surface).
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure all parts of your designated zone are within view. Move positions if your view is obstructed by things like glare, objects (people/floats), waves, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                One full scan should not take more than 10 seconds. Make sure to monitor all areas of the zone, do not solely focus on areas with high activity. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Scan by moving your head, not just your eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pick a scanning pattern: <em>right to left, left to right, diagonal</em>, and change patterns frequently to stay alert.
            </li>
            <li>
                Change positions every five minutes, either by standing up or walking around. Avoid sitting in one place for too long. When changing positions ensure your scanning does not falter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid distractions such as: talking to friends, looking at your phone, moving your mind off of the task at hand. <strong>No technology should be on the stand with you</strong>.
