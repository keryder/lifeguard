                <strong>Survey the scene</strong> to make an initial assessment. <strong>Put on gloves!</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Kneel down next to the person to <strong>check for responsiveness</strong>. For adults, this means tapping their shoulder and shouting their name. For small children, tap the bottom of their feet instead of their shoulder. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If the person is unresponsive, immediately <strong>call 911</strong>. Pointing at and assigning this role to a specific person reduces the risk of the bystander effect. If nobody was directly asked to call 911, it may lead to a delay in action.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Check for pulse and breathing</strong>. When checking for pulse, place two fingers (not the thumb) on the side of the neck. Tilt the head back with a palm on the forehead and with fingers lifting the chin. Place your ear next to their mouth to listen for breathing while watching if chest inflates.
